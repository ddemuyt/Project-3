# User Story

As a user , I want to be able to locate a charity worthy of my contributions to obtain a record of all my contributions,  to view funds are being directed to me and to see records for financial reporting 
purposes. For example, for tax reporting, and transactions made. I can also see Contributions done by month for the current year, total contributions by year
, Contribution increase/decrease by year , the  Transaction date , the payee name, the amount, and the memo.
